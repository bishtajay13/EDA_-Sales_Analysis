# EDA_Sales_Analysis

## Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the sales data. The aim is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
In this analysis we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

## Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning and Processing: Utilized Pandas for comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing like droping NaN vlaues, changing tye datatype of columns
2. Data Exploration: Employed Matplotlib for creating insightful graphs and plots. In this section we also explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:

* What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
* Which city sold the most product?
* What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
* Which products are most often sold together?
* Which products sold the most? Why do you think they sold the most?
